               <p class="text-muted text-left">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. In fact, online ordering is a system that has already been adopted by some schools. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

               <p id="ACCURACY" class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
<br>
2. Economics
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
<br>
3. Productivity / Efficiency
Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
